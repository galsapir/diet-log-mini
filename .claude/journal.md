# Diet Log Mini - Project Journal

## 2025-10-30 - Initial Project Planning

### Project Overview
Building simple diet logging app with Google integration
- User: Gal
- Goal: Track meals w/ pics + text in Google Sheet
- Host: GitHub Pages (static site, free HTTPS)
- Auth: Google OAuth

### Requirements Summary
1. **Auth Flow**: Login with Google account
2. **Sheet Management**: Auto-find or create "Diet Log_YEAR_MONTH_USERNAME"
3. **Meal Logging**:
   - Button (Material Design)
   - Add pic (stored in GDrive, link in sheet)
   - Add text description
   - Auto timestamp
   - Allow retrospective time edits
4. **Duplication**: Copy recent meals (editable)
5. **Sheet Columns**: Timestamp, Description, Image URL (GDrive link), Date, Time
   - Macros (calories, protein, carbs, fats) - DEFERRED for later
6. **Tech Stack Decisions**:
   - Client-side only (vanilla JS or React/Vue)
   - Google Sheets API + Drive API
   - OAuth with PKCE flow
   - Material Design (need to decide lib)

### Key Technical Decisions âœ…
- [x] Framework: Vanilla JS + Vite
- [x] Material Design: Material Web Components (MD3)
- [x] Sheet columns: Timestamp, Meal, Description, Image, Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fats (macros empty for now)
- [x] Images: Upload to GDrive, public links OK
- [x] Testing: Vitest unit tests, skip E2E

### Important Notes from claude.md
- TDD required for all features
- YAGNI principle
- Must commit frequently
- Use gh CLI for issues
- All files need ABOUTME: comments
- Must push back on bad ideas

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Planning phase discussion with Gal
- [x] Created PLAN.md with full implementation roadmap
- [x] Saved to repo (gh CLI blocked by hooks)
